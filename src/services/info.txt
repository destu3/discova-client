The services folder is a central location within the project that houses various service files. 
These service files are responsible for encapsulating the logic related to specific functionalities/features or interactions with external services that components use.

In this folder, you'll find service modules that handle tasks such as making API calls, performing data fetching operations, implementing utility functions, or managing interactions with third-party services.
These services act as a bridge between application components and the backend or external services.

This approach was used instead of putting the the logic directly into the component files. Allowing for reusability, readability, scalability and maintainability
